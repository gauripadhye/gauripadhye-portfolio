# gauripadhye-portfolio
Designed and developed my personal portfolio website entirely from scratch to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. The design was created using Figma, allowing for a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface. For implementation, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring responsive design and smooth interactivity.
